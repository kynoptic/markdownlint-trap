# Test fixtures for false positive fixes

This file tests various false positive scenarios identified in the ultimate-ranks evaluation.

## Backtick-code-elements fixes

### WCAG ratios (should NOT be flagged)

The color contrast ratio must meet WCAG AA standards of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. Some designs aim for AAA compliance with 7:1 ratios.

The Value field accepts Essential/Useful/Nice-to-have options to prioritize features. Similarly, the Effort field uses Heavy/Moderate/Light to estimate work.

### Bdd-style patterns (should not be flagged)

Test scenarios follow the GIVEN/WHEN/THEN format for clarity.

### Grammar pluralization (should NOT be flagged)

Update all issue(s) and PR(s) with the correct label(s) before merging the change(s).

### Data category labels (should NOT be flagged)

The API schema includes Data/API endpoints for resource management.

## Sentence-case-heading fixes

### Product names in headings (should NOT be flagged after configuration)

# Contributing to ultimate ranks
