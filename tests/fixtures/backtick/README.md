# `/tests/fixtures/backtick`

## Purpose

Sample Markdown files used to test the backtick code elements rule.

## Contents

### Files

- `passing.fixture.md` – contains valid usage of backticks around code elements
- `failing.fixture.md` – contains missing backticks that should be flagged

Each line is annotated with `<!-- ✅ -->` or `<!-- ❌ -->` so tests can check the expected outcome.
