 * Test fixture for the sentence-case-heading (SC001) custom markdownlint rule
 *
 * This file contains examples of both valid and invalid markdown headings according to the
 * sentence case rule. Each heading is annotated with an HTML comment indicating whether it
 * should pass (✅) or fail (❌) the rule check.
 *
 * The sentence case rule requires:
 *
 * * First word capitalized
 * * All other words lowercase (except acronyms ≤ 4 letters and the pronoun "I")
 * * No all-caps headings
 *
 * Annotations:
 *
 * * <!-- ✅ --> = This heading should PASS the rule check (no violations)
 * * <!-- ❌ --> = This heading should FAIL the rule check (rule should report a violation)
