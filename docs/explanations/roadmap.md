# Project roadmap

- [x] **Improved test coverage** – Add edge case fixtures to better exercise rule logic. Ensure each rule has comprehensive Jest tests.
- [x] **Documentation clean up** – Consolidate existing docs and add usage examples showing common configurations.
- [ ] **Automated release process** – Set up CI scripts to publish to `npm` and generate changelogs.
- [ ] **VS Code extension integration** – Provide steps and configuration for bundling these rules into a VS Code extension.
- [x] **Simplify test structure** – Map each fixture to a dedicated test file.
- [ ] **Enhanced documentation** – Add missing JSDoc comments for functions and utilities.
- [x] **Folder-level READMEs** – Document purpose and usage for each subdirectory.
